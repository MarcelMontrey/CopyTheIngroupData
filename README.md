# Description
Human data and analysis code from psychological study examining humans' preference for copying members of the same arbitrary social group. These data and analyses were reported in the following journal publication:

# Abstract
Surprisingly little is known about how social groups influence social learning. Although several studies have shown that people prefer to copy ingroup members, these have failed to resolve whether group membership genuinely affects who is copied or if it merely correlates with other known factors, such as similarity and familiarity. Using the minimal group paradigm, we disentangle these effects in an online social learning game. In a sample of 540 adults, we find a robust ingroup copying bias that (1) is bolstered by a preference for observing ingroup members; (2) overrides perceived reliability, warmth, and competence; (3) grows stronger when social information is scarce; and (4) even causes cultural divergence between intermixed groups. These results suggest that people genuinely employ a copy-the-ingroup social learning strategy, which could help explain how inefficient behaviors spread through social learning and how we maintain the cultural diversity needed for cumulative cultural evolution.
